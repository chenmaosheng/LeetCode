## Solution

The idea is to sort by digit of each element, from last digit to first digit

1, create a 10-element array

2, iterate the array, put each element to new array by the last digit of each element

3, iterate new array, and copy each element to old array

4, loop 2-3, from last digit to first digit

5, finish
